Hello World! I am [Ioannis](/about/).

This post marks the beginning of my new personal site and blog!

I will be posting about coding-related stuff and tools that are part of my daily routine and I enjoy working with. Also you can expect hints and tips that are coming from my remote-working life.

You can follow the blog by subscribing on the [RSS feed](/rss.xml).
