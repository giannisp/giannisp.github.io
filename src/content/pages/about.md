  Hello! My name is Ioannis, and I am a senior Software Developer.<br>
  If you are looking to hire an experienced developer or a CTO or even a consultant for your next awesome project, feel free to <a href="mailto:giannis.p@gmail.com">contact me</a>!
</p>

I live in [Thessaloniki, Greece](https://goo.gl/maps/WVo3Uja7t2T2) and I am working remotely for the past 10+ years.

I have got a BSc degree in Computer Science, and I love working and experimenting with bleeding-edge technologies.

My mission is to provide appropriate solutions to all encountered challenges, using clean and efficient code.

Throughout my [career](https://gr.linkedin.com/in/ipoulakas) I have worked with lots of different programming languages, platforms and frameworks on various projects and startups (both EU and US based).

In consulting I aim to help tech companies grow by using appropriate methodologies to deliver quality software. My experience and understanding of the entire stack not only helps providing solutions, but also prevents poor choices that could critically impact early-stage growth and future development.

Keep an eye on the blog about stuff that I currently follow and enjoy working with, and of course thank you for visiting my site!
